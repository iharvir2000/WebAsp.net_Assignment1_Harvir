Pen App - Harvir_Pen_Ass_1
Project Duration: 2023-10-11 to 2023-10-12

Introduction
2023-10-11, 09:00 AM: Today, I'm embarking on a new project for the "Pen App." This project, "Harvir_Pen_Ass_1," is an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application that will showcase our range of pens. I'm documenting my progress, which includes both the successes and the errors encountered during development.

Project Setup
2023-10-11, 09:30 AM: I've set up the project, naming it "Harvir_Pen_Ass_1." To ensure version control and back up my work, I've created a GitHub repository at Pen App - Harvir_Pen_Ass_1 Repository.

2023-10-11, 10:00 AM: While configuring Individual User Accounts authentication, I encountered an issue. The initial setup took longer than expected due to an unexpected configuration problem.

Authentication and Security
2023-10-11, 11:00 AM: Security is a top priority. After overcoming the authentication issue, I've successfully configured the application to use Individual User Accounts authentication, ensuring certain features are protected. Additionally, I've enabled HTTPS to enhance security.

Project Structure
2023-10-11, 11:45 AM: To maintain a clean and organized codebase, I've adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for this project. This separation of concerns will make the application more maintainable.

Product Catalog
2023-10-11, 01:00 PM: The project now has a home page that reflects our company name, "Pen App." It also features a link to navigate to the product catalog.

2023-10-11, 02:30 PM: Working on the product catalog, I encountered a formatting issue with product images. It took some time to resolve this problem, but it's now visually appealing with product images, customized styling, and unique color preferences.

About Us
2023-10-11, 03:45 PM: I've created an "About Us" page that provides insights into "Pen App." It includes information about the company, corporate headquarters, staff, and a general description of our pens.

2023-10-11, 04:30 PM: When implementing the "About Us" page, I faced a challenge with formatting. It took additional time to align the content properly.

Database Seeding
2023-10-11, 05:45 PM: To effectively showcase our pens, I've seeded the database with at least ten product items. Each pen has a minimum of six attributes, including customer reviews on a half-rating scale from 1 to 5 (poor to excellent).

2023-10-11, 06:30 PM: During the database seeding process, I encountered a data validation error. It was necessary to revisit the data seeding code and make the necessary corrections.

Project Files
In the "Harvir_Pen_Ass_1" project, you'll find several key files, including:

Pen.cs: This model file defines the properties and attributes of our pens. It includes attributes such as name, price, ink color, tip type, material, weight, and customer reviews.
Known Issues
2023-10-12, 09:00 AM: While making progress, I encountered an issue with the product catalog. Some product details were not displaying correctly, causing confusion for users. I'm actively working on resolving this issue.

2023-10-12, 10:30 AM: The database seeding error resurfaced, leading to incorrect data entries. This is a critical issue that requires immediate attention.

Future Improvements
2023-10-12, 11:45 AM: Moving forward, I plan to address the known issues, enhance error handling, and improve the validation process. Additionally, I'll implement search and filtering options for the product catalog to enhance the user experience.
